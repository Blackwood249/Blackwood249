# WHO AM I 
            
          
Hello, Iâ€™m Lucas Madeira â€” a Telecommunications Engineer graduated from UFF who made a bold transition from engineering to the financial market, with a clear focus on Private Banking.

After graduating, I decided to leave the telecommunications industry to pursue my true passion: helping high-net-worth individuals grow and protect their wealth. To support this career shift, I completed an MBA in Data Science, Business Intelligence, and Artificial Intelligence, and I am currently pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Administration.

My expertise lies at the intersection of finance and technology. I leverage tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn), R, SQL, Excel, VBA, and Power BI to develop data-driven solutions for portfolio analysis, risk assessment, asset allocation, and client reporting â€” all essential for delivering a personalized and analytical approach in the Private Banking sector.

I believe in combining technical excellence with strategic thinking to deliver real value to both clients and financial institutions.
# MY SKILLS
ðŸ’¼ What You'll Find Here
I focus on building solutions that connect programming, finance, and automation. My technical toolkit is designed to support financial modeling, data analysis, and business intelligence through code and visualization.

I work primarily with Python, a powerful language for financial applications. I use Pandas for time series and structured data manipulation, NumPy for efficient numerical computations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating impactful financial visualizations. For predictive modeling, I apply Scikit-learn, while yfinance helps retrieve and analyze real-time market data. I also use Statsmodels for econometric and statistical analysis, and present results in Jupyter Notebook.

With R, I explore and model data using packages like ggplot2 for elegant charts, tidyverse for structured data workflows, quantmod and TTR for building and testing trading strategies, and Shiny to create interactive financial dashboards.

In SQL, I manage and query relational databases for extracting financial insights, automating report generation, and structuring historical data for investment decisions.

I also have strong expertise in Power BI and Microsoft Excel. I use Power BI to build automated dashboards and visual reports using DAX, while in Excel, I work with advanced formulas, pivot tables, and macros. With VBA, I create custom solutions that streamline financial tasks and enhance spreadsheet functionality.

My goal is to turn raw financial and operational data into strategic insights, supporting professionals and organizations in making smarter and faster decisions.
