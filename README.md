# WHO AM I

Hello, I’m Lucas Madeira — a Telecommunications Engineer graduated from UFF with strong experience in RF, networking, and telecom systems. After exploring other opportunities, I decided to focus on leveraging my technical expertise to solve complex challenges in the telecommunications industry.

I have hands-on experience in network monitoring, performance analysis, RF planning, and automation of operational tasks. I combine engineering knowledge with programming skills to improve network efficiency, troubleshoot issues, and deliver data-driven insights for telecom operations.

# MY SKILLS

💼 **Technical Focus for Telecommunications**

I specialize in **building solutions that connect programming, automation, and network operations**. My toolkit supports monitoring, analysis, and management of telecom systems, from core networks to VSAT, RF links, and IP infrastructure.

- **Python** 🐍 – Automating network monitoring, analyzing logs, generating reports, and performing predictive maintenance. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, PySNMP.
- **R** – Statistical analysis of network performance and signal quality metrics, trend modeling, and anomaly detection.
- **SQL / PostgreSQL / MySQL** – Querying network databases, analyzing historical performance data, and automating reporting pipelines.
- **Bash / Shell Script** – Automating network tasks, backups, and system monitoring on Linux servers.
- **C / C++** – Developing low-level network tools, RF simulation, and hardware integration.
- **Java / Scala** – Building scalable backend systems for network management and big data processing.
- **Power BI & Excel / VBA** – Creating dashboards to monitor KPIs, automate reports, and visualize network performance.

💡 **Additional Technical Knowledge**

- **Mobile & Embedded Systems**: Flutter, Kotlin, Objective-C — for creating mobile network monitoring apps, dashboards, and field tools.  
- **Web Development**: Python (Django), JavaScript, TypeScript, AngularJS, HTML5, PHP — for developing network management portals, real-time dashboards, and telecom automation tools.  
- **Other Frameworks**: Ruby on Rails — for rapid prototyping of network monitoring MVPs or telecom analytics platforms.  

My goal is to **turn raw network and operational data into actionable insights**, automating tasks and supporting telecom engineers, operators, and managers in making faster, smarter decisions.
