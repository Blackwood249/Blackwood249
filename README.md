# WHO AM I
Hello, I am Lucas Madeira, a telecommunications engineer graduated from UFF who left the engineering career to pursue a career in the financial market. I am a specialist in investments. I connect data science, artificial intelligence, and investments.

# MY SKILLS
ðŸ’¼ What You'll Find Here
I focus on building solutions that connect programming, finance, and automation. My technical toolkit is designed to support financial modeling, data analysis, and business intelligence through code and visualization.

I work primarily with Python, a powerful language for financial applications. I use Pandas for time series and structured data manipulation, NumPy for efficient numerical computations, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating impactful financial visualizations. For predictive modeling, I apply Scikit-learn, while yfinance helps retrieve and analyze real-time market data. I also use Statsmodels for econometric and statistical analysis, and present results in Jupyter Notebook.

With R, I explore and model data using packages like ggplot2 for elegant charts, tidyverse for structured data workflows, quantmod and TTR for building and testing trading strategies, and Shiny to create interactive financial dashboards.

In SQL, I manage and query relational databases for extracting financial insights, automating report generation, and structuring historical data for investment decisions.

I also have strong expertise in Power BI and Microsoft Excel. I use Power BI to build automated dashboards and visual reports using DAX, while in Excel, I work with advanced formulas, pivot tables, and macros. With VBA, I create custom solutions that streamline financial tasks and enhance spreadsheet functionality.

My goal is to turn raw financial and operational data into strategic insights, supporting professionals and organizations in making smarter and faster decisions.
